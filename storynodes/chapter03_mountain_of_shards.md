The Wanderer followed the path of falling stars until it led them to a mountain.  
Its peak touched the heavens, its slopes glittering with fragments of broken constellations.  
Each shard pulsed faintly, humming like heartbeats buried in stone.  

The climb was steep.  
With every step, the Wandererâ€™s lantern flickered â€” sometimes strong, sometimes weak, as though the mountain tested their resolve.  

At one point, they stumbled.  
A shard cut their hand, drawing blood.  
Yet when their blood touched the shard, it glowed brighter and fused into the lanternâ€™s flame.  

The Wanderer understood:  
The shards were not gifts to be taken.  
They were burdens to be earned, each demanding sacrifice.  

At last, near the summit, the Wanderer found a massive shard unlike the rest â€” it glowed with a warmth that felt like a heartbeat.  
When they reached for it, the shard dissolved into their chest.  
The lantern blazed so brightly it painted the sky with fire.  

The mountain whispered:  
*"Every wound you carry becomes light for the road ahead."*  

**Lesson**: Pain endured can become strength shared.

At the summit, the Wanderer saw the horizon split into three â€” a forest, a river, and a ruined city lit faintly by sparks.  
Each shimmered with possibility.

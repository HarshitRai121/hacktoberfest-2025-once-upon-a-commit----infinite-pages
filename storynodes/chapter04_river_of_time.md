The Wanderer walked until the sound of the child’s lantern faded into memory.  
Before them stretched a river wider than sight, glowing faintly under the twin moons.  
Its surface shimmered like molten glass, yet beneath the light, shadows moved—slow, patient, eternal.

They knelt and touched the water.  It was cool, but not cold; it pulsed with a heartbeat that did not belong to them.  
When they leaned closer, they saw not their face, but a thousand versions of it—laughing, crying, aging, fading.  
Each image drifted by like a fallen leaf.

A soft voice rose from the current:

> “Every moment you remember is a bridge.  
>  Every moment you cling to is an anchor.”

The Wanderer waded in.  The current caught their legs, gentle at first, then urgent.  
Each step deeper brought another memory: the first spark of courage on the Blank Page, the mirrors that lied and told the truth, the echoes that spoke of fear.  
Their lantern dimmed, its flame flickering as if struggling to stay above the tide.

For a moment, panic seized them.  They tried to hold the water still, cupping it in trembling hands—but time, like water, would not obey.  
It slipped through their fingers, leaving only the weight of longing.

Then they remembered the child’s words: *“Even when it feels like I am alone.”*  
The Wanderer raised the lantern high.  Its light met the water, and the reflections changed.  
The faces smiled—not as strangers, but as companions.  Each bowed and melted into light that flowed downstream.

The current gentled.  The Wanderer stepped out, dripping gold.  
On the far bank stood a bridge of mist leading toward dawn.

**Lesson**: The past is not a chain but a river; it carries us only when we release our grip.

🔮 **Passing the Torch**  
Across the river, the Wanderer sees a silent city of silver towers glimmering like unspoken promises.

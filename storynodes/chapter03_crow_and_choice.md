The Wanderer left the Valley of Echoes and found the Crow waiting.  
It perched on a twisted tree, its feathers black as ink, its eyes gleaming with unsettling clarity.  

“You listened to your fears,” said the Crow.  
“Now tell me — which will you obey, and which will you defy?”  

The Wanderer hesitated.  
The lantern felt heavy, as though weighed down by every doubt they had ever carried.  

The Crow spread its wings, and suddenly the world around them shifted.  
Two roads appeared:  

One was bright and golden, filled with voices cheering, promises of victory and safety.  
The other was narrow and dark, winding into unknown shadows where no voices called at all.  

The Wanderer’s chest ached.  
The golden road promised everything they had ever wanted.  
But something about it felt hollow, like a reflection that showed only what one wished to see.  

The dark road frightened them, but the lantern’s flame leaned toward it, flickering insistently.  

The Crow tilted its head.  
“Your lantern knows. Do you?”  

With trembling hands, the Wanderer stepped onto the darker path.  
The Crow followed silently, then whispered:  
*"True courage is not walking where voices guide you, but where your heart insists you must go."*  

**Lesson**: The easiest path is rarely the truest one.

🔮 **Passing the Torch**  
The path curved toward a mountain where the air shimmered as though woven with unseen fire.

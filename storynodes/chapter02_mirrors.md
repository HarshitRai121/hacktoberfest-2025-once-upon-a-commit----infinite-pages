The Wanderer stepped onto the path of mirrors.  
The air grew colder, and the ground beneath their feet hardened into polished glass.  
Soon they were surrounded by towering walls of crystal, each reflecting a version of themselves they had never seen.  

In one mirror, they wore a crown â€” their eyes sharp, their smile cruel.  
In another, they were a beggar, hollow-cheeked and weary.  
One reflection was only a child, clutching a wooden toy and staring longingly at the stars.  

The Wanderer pressed their palm against the glass.  
The reflection pressed back.  
But when they smiled, the reflection frowned.  

They tried another mirror â€” this one showed them victorious in battle, but the eyes were empty, lifeless.  
The Wanderer recoiled.  
The mirrors seemed to whisper:  
*"You are all of these, yet none of these."*  

At last, the Wanderer touched a mirror that did not distort, did not exaggerate.  
It showed them exactly as they were: trembling, tired, but still holding the lantern.  
Tears welled in their eyes.  

*"Not every reflection is truth,"* the Lantern whispered.  
*"The truest mirror is the one that does not lie, even when you wish it would."*  

**Lesson**: We are not who we could have been, but who we choose to become.

The final mirror melted into a doorway, opening into a shadowed forest where countless lanterns hung, swinging as if waiting for someone to pass through.

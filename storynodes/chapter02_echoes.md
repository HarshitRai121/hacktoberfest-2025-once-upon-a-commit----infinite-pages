The Wanderer chose the path of echoes.  
The ground gave way to a narrow canyon, its walls rising high like broken cathedrals.  
Each step they took sent ripples of sound across the valley â€” their footsteps multiplied, magnified, until it felt as though a thousand versions of themselves were walking beside them.  

At first, the echoes were harmless.  
But soon, they began to twist.  

*"Turn back."*  
*"You are not ready."*  
*"This road is not yours."*  

The voices grew sharper, until they pierced like knives.  
The Wanderer covered their ears, but the echoes were not outside â€” they were inside.  
It was their own voice, the shadow of doubt that had lived with them since before the blank page.  

The lantern dimmed, its flame sputtering.  
The Wanderer sank to their knees, overwhelmed.  

That was when a sound unlike the others broke through â€” a single *caw*.  
A black crow perched above them on a jagged branch.  
Its eyes gleamed like obsidian, and when it spoke, its voice cut through the noise:  

*"Do not silence them. Listen."*  

The Wanderer opened their ears again, and the echoes softened.  
They no longer sounded like commands, but confessions:  
*"I am afraid of being forgotten."*  
*"I fear I will never be enough."*  
*"I wish I could begin again."*  

The Wanderer breathed deeply.  
The voices were not enemies.  
They were pieces of themselves they had never faced.  

**Lesson**: Doubt is not an enemy to silence, but a voice to understand.

At the end of the valley, through the fog, a single lantern flickered â€” not theirs, but a childâ€™s, glowing steadily in the darkness.

At the edge of all things, before the first word was written and before the first star was born, there was a page.  
A page without ink, without lines, without end.  

Upon this page stood a Wanderer.  
They had no name, no past, no memory â€” only a faint lantern glowing in their hand.  
The light was fragile, flickering as though it might vanish at any moment, yet it was the only thing that made them real.  

The Wanderer looked around and saw nothing but silence.  
The silence was heavy, like a question that had waited for eternity to be answered.  
In that silence, a voice rose â€” not loud, not soft, but steady, as if it had always been there:  

*"Every path begins with a choice, and every choice becomes a story."*  

As the voice faded, the page before the Wanderer rippled.  
From the white emptiness, three paths revealed themselves:  

- One path shimmered like a corridor of **mirrors**, each glinting with unfamiliar reflections.  
- Another trembled with the sound of **echoes**, though no one was there to speak them.  
- The last rose into a sky of **stars**, constellations glittering like promises waiting to be broken or fulfilled.  

The Wanderer tightened their grip on the lantern.  
They felt fear.  
They felt wonder.  
But above all, they felt something stir in their chest: the need to walk forward.  

**Lesson**: Every beginning is born not from certainty, but from courage to take the first step.

ðŸ”® **Passing the Torch**  
The Wanderer must choose one of three roads:  
- The path of **mirrors**, reflecting countless lives.  
- The path of **echoes**, where voices wait in the shadows.  
- The path of **stars**, where fragments of destiny fall from the heavens.

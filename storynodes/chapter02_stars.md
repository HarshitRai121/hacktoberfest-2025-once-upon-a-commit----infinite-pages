The Wanderer lifted their lantern and chose the path of stars.  
The blank page beneath their feet dissolved into a vast night sky.  
Each step they took was not on soil, but on beams of light stretched between constellations.  

The stars whispered as they walked â€” not words, but feelings: warmth, sorrow, longing.  
They passed a constellation shaped like a sword, another like a crown, another like an open hand.  
Each pulsed faintly, as though alive.  

Suddenly, one star fell from the sky and landed before them.  
It shimmered like molten glass, humming softly in the Wandererâ€™s palms.  
They held it close, and a warmth surged through their chest.  

The Lanternâ€™s voice echoed:  
*"These are not just stars. They are fragments of your destiny."*  

The Wanderer turned the shard over.  
On its surface glimmered shifting words, written not in ink, but in fire:  
*"Your path is not given to you. It is carried by you."*  

The shard dissolved into their lantern.  
Its flame grew brighter, no longer fragile but fierce.  
For the first time, the Wanderer felt not only fear, but strength.  

**Lesson**: What seems distant and unreachable may already live within us.

The shards of falling stars rained all around, forming a glowing path that led to a mountain whose peak pierced the heavens.

The Wanderer stepped through the doorway that melted from the final mirror.  
They found themselves in a forest unlike any they had seen — if such a forest could exist at all.  
The trees were tall and pale, their branches bare, yet each branch carried a lantern.  

Hundreds, perhaps thousands of lanterns, swayed gently, lighting the darkness with soft, golden flames.  
The Wanderer’s own lantern flickered in response, as though greeting its kin.  

As they walked deeper, they noticed something strange:  
Some lanterns burned brightly, others were weak and fading, and a few hung cold and lifeless, their flames long extinguished.  

*"These are lives,"* the Wanderer thought.  
*"Every flame is a choice, every flicker a story."*  

They stopped by one dim lantern, trembling like it might die at any moment.  
When they cupped their hand around it, shielding it from the unseen wind, the flame grew stronger.  
A warmth traveled back into their chest.  

The forest whispered: *“Every light you protect, protects you.”*  

By the time they reached the forest’s end, the Wanderer’s lantern burned brighter than it ever had before.  

**Lesson**: Kindness given to others will one day return to guide you.

🔮 **Passing the Torch**  
The lanterns ahead formed a glowing path that led into a valley, where shadows twisted into shapes the Wanderer could not yet name.

At the end of the Valley of Echoes, the Wanderer saw a flicker.  
It was not the harsh light of doubt, nor the cold gleam of mirrors — but something gentler.  

A child stood there, holding a lantern much smaller than the Wanderer’s.  
The child’s face glowed with quiet joy, though their clothes were ragged and their feet bare.  

“Why do you carry a lantern?” the Wanderer asked.  
The child tilted their head.  
“To remind myself I am not alone. Even when it feels like I am.”  

The words struck the Wanderer deeper than any echo.  
The child offered their lantern, but the Wanderer shook their head.  

“No,” said the Wanderer softly. “Yours must stay with you.”  

Instead, they bent down and let their lantern’s flame touch the child’s.  
For a moment, the two lights merged, brighter than either alone.  

The child smiled and whispered:  
*"Sometimes, the smallest flame can teach the largest one how to shine."*  

**Lesson**: Strength is not always found in size, but in sharing light.

🔮 **Passing the Torch**  
The child pointed toward a winding river glistening under moonlight.  
“The water will carry you further than your feet can,” they said.

‚úçÔ∏è **Your Story**
The Wanderer walked where the path forgot its name. Mist pooled like soft grief between the trunks; the lantern at their hip breathed a thin, steady light. Each step swallowed sound, and the world narrowed to the lantern's small orbit ‚Äî moss, a low bird-call, the scuff of worn leather. The light did not chase the fog away; it simply made one small place honest and known.

A Crow alighted on a nearby stone and watched. The Crow did not caw; it tilted its head as if listening for the name the Wanderer kept searching for. "Why carry that little lantern when the world is so wide?" the Crow might have asked, if it spoke like the elders.

The Wanderer answered only by walking. With every careful step, the lantern's rim caught a shard ‚Äî a memory, a fear, a kindness ‚Äî and folded it into the light. Where once the Wanderer had feared losing pieces of themselves, they began to find purpose in how those pieces fit into the glow.

In the hush between breaths, an old voice ‚Äî the lending kind of voice, like someone offering a cloak ‚Äî spoke from beyond the tree-line. "You are learning to turn wound into wick," it said. "Small light burns longer than great fury."

The mist thinned where the lantern touched it, not because light banished fog, but because light gave the Wanderer a place to stand and a direction to move. The road out of the mist would not promise certainty. It promised only one honest thing: a foot forward.

üåü **Lesson Learned**
Light is not the absence of shadow; it is the choice to make one small place honest.

üîÆ **Passing the Torch**
Ahead, the path split into three ‚Äî one leading to a **River of Echoes**, another across a **Bridge of Decisions**, and the last toward a **Ruined City**. Each waited for a new voice to continue the story.
